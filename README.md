# simple-weather-app

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's full-stack javascript curriculum.  The primary aim of the project was to practice making API requests and using promises/async functions.  The app takes a city name as input, and fetches data from the Open Weater API to display the current weather and a five-day forecast.
